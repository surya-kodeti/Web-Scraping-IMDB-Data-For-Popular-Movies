# Web_Scraping_IMDB
Developed a Python-based web scraping tool,designed to extract movie-related data from the IMDB website. Utilized BeautifulSoup and requests libraries to fetch and parse web pages, extracting details such as movie names, ratings, descriptions, and trailers. The scraped data is efficiently processed and exported to a CSV file for further analysis.
